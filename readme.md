- set environment variable in powershell: $env:DEBUG="dev"
- remove enviroment variable: $env:DEBUG=""
- package "debug" only works with variables set by command line, not with variables in .env 
- "dotenv" package also tries to retrieve variables set by command line first, if the variable is not set, the value from .env will be used
